Reduction
=========

The most efficient CUDA implementation of the Reduction pattern I could compose, running under a small autotuning framework.

You need to have:
  * R 
  * CUDA > v5.0
  * alex package in Haskell

To run:
  * make build_parsers and then run the autotunner.sh scirpt
  * make clear to reinstate the project
